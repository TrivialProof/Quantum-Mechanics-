# Quantum-Mechanics
My attempt at solutions from the book "Quantum Mechanics, The Theoretical Minimum", by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman.

This probably exists out there already, but I'm hoping to use this mini-project as a way to improve my GitHub and QM skills/knowledge. It will probably take me a while to get through it all.
